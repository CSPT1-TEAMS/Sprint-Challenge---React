What is React JS? What types of problems does it solve?
<!-- it solves the problems that websites have when rendering information. instead of having the whole page re render react renders components and each component in independet in its rendering allowing parts of a page to update. it also creates a nice environment to structure code and be more efficient in building an application. -->

<!-- the React component life-cycle illustrats how components can be manipulated from before they are mounted to when they are unmounted or removed.

componentDidMount - if a component rendered itself immediatly after perform an action
componentDidUpdate - if an update was recevied perform some action.

componentWillUnmount - before a component is removed perform some action. -->

<!-- A class componenet has access to reacts this.state and a constructor. you can use prebuilt methods
a functional component is good for rendering html to the dom. -->
